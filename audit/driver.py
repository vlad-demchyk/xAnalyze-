"""Driving a real browser over a page, off screen.

`browser.py` builds the JavaScript and normalises what comes back;
`states.py` builds the state pass. This is the missing third of that job: the
thing that actually loads the page, waits for it to settle, runs each script
and collects the answers.

It exists because QtWebEngine is already in the application — the same
Chromium that paints the page preview — so the industry-standard engines run
with no Node, no Puppeteer and no new dependency.

Three properties of `QWebEnginePage.runJavaScript` shape everything here:

**It cannot await a promise.** `axe.run()` and `HTMLCS.process()` both settle
asynchronously, and handing their Promise to `runJavaScript` returns the
Promise object, not the result. So every script is wrapped to park its answer
on a global slot, and the slot is then polled. Polling reads worse than
awaiting and is the only thing that works.

**It is a callback, not a return value.** The whole run is therefore a small
state machine over one nested `QEventLoop`, rather than a sequence of calls.

**It has to be on the main thread.** QtWebEngine is not usable from a worker
thread, so this blocks the thread it is called on and pumps events while it
waits. In the window that means the UI stays responsive but the audit cannot
be moved to `ui/worker.py`; in the CLI it means nothing at all.

Everything this returns is already an `Issue`, deduplicated against the rule
families in `browser.py`, so a caller never learns which engine found what
unless it looks at `Issue.engine`.
