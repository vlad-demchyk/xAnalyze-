"""What a repository reveals about itself, as opposed to what its pages do.

Three different questions live here, and they share a module because they
share a method: none of them judges anything. Each reads a fact that is
either present or absent, the way `unicode_rules` reads a zero-width
character and `audit/rules/provenance.py` reads a vendor class name.

**Who wrote it.** A commit trailer naming an assistant is a record, not an
inference. Every classifier in this tool is guessing at whether a model
wrote a passage; the repository has been keeping the answer in plain text
the whole time. It is reported as provenance, not as a problem: writing code
with an assistant is not a defect, and the tool that says otherwise is
telling people how to work.

**What the assistants left behind.** `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/`, a Copilot
instructions file: committed configuration for tools that wrote here.
Interesting for the same reason, and for one more - these files often carry
project context somebody did not mean to publish.

**What is about to leak.** A `.env` that no ignore rule covers is a
credential waiting for the next `git add .`, and one that is already tracked
is a credential that has been published and needs rotating, not deleting.
Those are different findings with different fixes, and telling them apart
needs git rather than the filesystem - so it asks git, and says so when it
cannot.

Everything here degrades to silence rather than to a guess. A folder that is
not a git repository produces no commit findings at all, because "no
assistant commits found" and "no history to look at" are opposite statements
and only one of them is true.
