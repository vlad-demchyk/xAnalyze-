"""Auditing one part of a page rather than the whole page.

Some work is delivered as a *fragment of somebody else's document*. A
SharePoint web part is the clearest case: the page around it is the tenant's
- suite bar, site navigation, comments, footer, all of it emitted by
Microsoft - and the only thing the developer wrote, and the only thing they
can fix, is one subtree. Auditing the whole page there reports hundreds of
findings against markup the reader has no access to, and buries the handful
that are theirs.

The suppression list answers the opposite question: "not inside this part".
Saying "**only** inside this part" needs its own answer, and this is it.

Two things make it usable on a real SharePoint page rather than only in
principle:

* the platform generates the identifiers. `ControlZone_1a2b3c`,
  `WebPartWPQ3`, `root-137` - the suffix changes between renders and between
  environments, so a selector typed once stops matching. A selector that
  finds nothing is therefore retried against the *stem* of each class and
  id, which is the part the developer wrote.
* what actually got used has to be said out loud. A scope that silently
  matched nothing would report a clean page, and a clean page is what a
  reader is least equipped to doubt.
