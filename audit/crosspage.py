"""What only a whole crawl can see.

Every rule in `audit.rules` reads one document, which makes a class of real
problem invisible by construction: the same `<title>` on forty pages is
perfectly valid markup on each of them and a broken site taken together. The
crawl already holds every page, so this costs nothing but the comparison.

Reported once, on the run, rather than once per page. Forty findings saying
"this title is also on thirty-nine other pages" would be the same inflation
`duplicates` exists to remove, arriving from a different direction.

Two things this does not do:

* **Report a duplicate as a duplicate when the pages are the same page.**
  A crawl that reached `/about` and `/about/` already collapses them, and
  what survives here is compared by final address.
* **Judge similarity.** Two titles are the same or they are not. "Nearly the
  same title" is a threshold nobody can defend, and the moment it exists
  someone tunes it.

    and to a neighbouring village's in English and German. Nothing about it is
    invalid - every address is well-formed and returns 200 - and nothing on one
    page shows it. It only shows when the two pages are held side by side,

    added or dropped a link has no such correspondence, and guessing one would

    A destination counts as the same when the language is the only difference
    (`it.` / `en.` subdomain, `/en/` prefix, `?lang=`). An internal pair is
