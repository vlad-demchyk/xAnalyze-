"""Security rules: markup that hands something away.

The category existed with no rules in it. `audit.repo_facts` was filing a
committed `.env` under `security` and nothing else ever did, so the word in
the report meant "one particular repository check ran" rather than "the
markup was looked at for this".

Every rule here is deliberately `EXACT`. That is not a coincidence and it is
the reason this category was safe to open: each one asks a question the markup
answers on its own - is there a `sandbox` attribute, is the action `http://`,
is there an `integrity` next to that cross-origin `src`. None of them needs a
stylesheet, a browser or a guess, which is what the four large false-positive
classes this tool has shipped all needed. A security finding that turns out to
be wrong costs more trust than any other kind, so nothing that has to infer
belongs here.

What is deliberately *not* here: anything that would need to fetch the URL, run
the script or know the server's headers. A `Content-Security-Policy` sent as a
header is invisible to a file on disk, and reporting its absence from the
markup would be a finding about the scan rather than the page.
