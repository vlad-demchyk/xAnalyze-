"""Performance rules that a static pass can honestly make.

The split matters here more than anywhere else in this package. Real
performance is a measurement — how long the page took, on what connection,
on what hardware — and no amount of reading markup produces a number. What
markup *does* answer is the question underneath most slow pages: **what did
the browser have to do before it could show anything?**

So these rules report *causes*, never times, and never a score. A page with
six render-blocking scripts in the head is slow for a reason that is visible
in the HTML; whether it takes 1.2s or 6s depends on the network, and the
browser pass (`audit/browser.py`) is what supplies that.

Anything claiming to be a measurement is marked `NEEDS_BROWSER`, so a
report never presents an inference as a reading.
