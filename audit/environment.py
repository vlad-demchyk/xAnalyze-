"""Findings that describe the machine a page was served from, not the page.

A crawl of `http://palmanova.local` reported 365 critical findings. Every one
was a form whose `action` was `http://...`, because a local development site
is served over plain HTTP: there is nothing to change in the code. Beside them,
381 pages each missing a `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
`Referrer-Policy` and `X-Frame-Options` header, which a local nginx does not
send and a production server does. The developer read the top of the list,
spent time on it, and found that none of it was a defect in the project.

So on a local target these findings are **left out of the list and counted**.
Not deleted silently: the run says how many it left out and why, `--json`
carries them as `environment`, and `--include-environment` puts them back. The
same shape as `--unsettled`, for the same reason: hiding a number is how a
report starts to lie by omission, and showing everything is how it stops being
read.

What is *not* in the list: anything about the markup, the scripts, the images,
the accessibility or the SEO of the page. A third-party script loaded
synchronously is as much a defect on `palmanova.local` as on `palmanova.it`.
Only what the server (not the code) decides, and what a plain-HTTP address
makes inevitable, is environment.

Applied to a **web** audit only. In repo mode a template containing
`action="http://..."` is a finding about the code, and stays one.
