"""`xanalyze-desktop.css` is the design system, and it is complete.

It began as a thin layer over xFormat's shared web token file - only the
values that differ - which quietly made that file mandatory. The cost was
not theoretical: no bundle ever shipped the overlay, `overlay_file()`
degrades to the shared file without saying so, and every frozen build
painted in xFormat's web colours while the source tree painted in
XAnalyze's. The same severity was #e5484d in one place and #c0564f in
another, in one product.

Two properties keep that from coming back, and they are different claims:

* **Complete.** Every token `Palette` reads is declared here, in both
  themes, so the app is correct with no base file at all.
* **Authoritative.** Layering the shared file underneath changes nothing.
  Completeness alone would not give this - a token could be declared here
  and still be overridden if the layering ran the other way.

The values themselves are read off the design bundle's artboards by counting
what they use, so the numbers in `KNOWN_FROM_THE_ARTBOOK` below are
assertions about the bundle, not preferences.
