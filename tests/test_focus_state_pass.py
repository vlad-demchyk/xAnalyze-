"""The focus pass reports nothing when it cannot see focus.

A document that does not itself have focus never matches `:focus` in
Chromium. `el.focus()` still sets `activeElement`, so the check believed it
had focused the element - but no focus rule applied, no computed style
changed, and every focusable element on the page came back with a missing
indicator.

Measured against `https://www.gov.uk/`, whose focus state is among the most
tested on the web: 588 serious findings across ten pages, one for very nearly
every element examined. Confirmed in a live browser - `document.hasFocus()`
was `false` and `el.matches(':focus')` was `false` immediately after
`el.focus()`.

Two rules follow, and this file pins both in the script's source, since the
script itself only runs inside a browser:

* the pass must establish that it *can* see focus before reporting that a
  ring is missing;
* what counts as an indicator is any visible change, not an outline - GOV.UK
  draws a yellow background, and 83 rules in its stylesheet set `background`
  on `:focus`.

    """A page is not missing a skip link because the tool speaks fewer
    languages than the page does.

    The check took the first five in-page anchors and matched their text
    against `skip|jump|перейти|content|main|vai`. Measured 2026-09-01 on a
    live trilingual site: the German page was reported as having no skip
    link, and the finding quoted that page's own skip link -
    `<a id="palmanova-skip-to-content" class="…skiplink-link"
    href="#main-container">Zum Inhalt springen</a>` - as the element it was
    about. Whether it fires at all depends on what the other four anchors
    happen to say, which is a flaky answer as well as a wrong one.

    Two structural signals now come first, and they hold in any language:
    the element says `skip` in its own id or class, or its `href` points at
    the document's main landmark.
