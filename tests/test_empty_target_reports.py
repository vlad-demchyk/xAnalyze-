"""A target nothing was read from still produces the reports it was asked for.

The founding defect of this project, found again on a real path. `fullscan`
over a directory the scanner reads nothing in used to answer `None` from
`_audit_fullscan_target`, and `None` travels: `_write_markdown_briefing`
skips on it, `_styled_report_model` returns `None` on it, so both writers
returned without a word. The run printed `total_findings: 0`, exited 0, and
wrote neither `--report` nor `--styled-report`.

Two people are hurt by that. Whoever reads the output sees a clean bill of
health for a target nothing was opened in. Whatever runs next - an agent, a
CI step - opens `--report` and finds no file, after a success exit.

Found on `~/Desktop/XAnalyze/contrast.html`, which is a directory of old run
folders rather than the page its name suggests. An over-broad `--exclude`, an
`--ext` that matches nothing, or one wrong path component all land here.
