"""`corpus/prose.jsonl`: human writing on the subjects a scan is pointed at.

The corpus's human half is interface strings plus encyclopedic paragraphs
about the web, and "0 false alarms" was measured on that. It was a claim
about the wrong text. A scan is pointed at pages about tourism, software,
marketing and usability, and those are exactly the subjects whose ordinary
vocabulary collides with a marketing cliché list - `efficienza` is what an
Italian article on productivity is made of, `scalable` is what one about
cloud computing is made of.

Measured 2026-08-31, the first time this file existed: **six** of these human
paragraphs crossed the reporting threshold, one cliché entry each. Eleven
further entries matched this text without crossing, and each caught no more
positives than it cost. All seventeen were removed, and held-out recall went
from (en 11/20, it 4/11, uk 10/14) to exactly the same numbers.
