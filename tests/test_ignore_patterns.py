"""What a scan refuses to open, as a table rather than as a library's mood.

`repo_scanner` matches ignore patterns through `pathspec`, and pathspec has
more than one dialect: `gitwildmatch`, which this project used and which is
now deprecated, and `gitignore`, which replaced it. Swapping them decides
what every scan reads, so it was not done on the strength of a deprecation
warning - the two were compared over the project's own 36 default patterns
and a set of edge cases a user's `.xanalyze-ignore` might contain, and they
disagreed nowhere.

This file is what remains after that comparison: the behaviour itself,
written down. Comparing against the deprecated dialect forever would pin
this project to the thing it just left; a table says what the tool must do
and fails if any future version of anything moves it.

The one that matters most is `node_modules/`. A walk that stops honouring
it does not fail - it reads a hundred megabytes of dependencies and reports
findings in code nobody here wrote.
