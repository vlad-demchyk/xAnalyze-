"""Choosing `xformat` in the TUI used to be a choice you could not act on.

Settings offers three providers. Two of them own their credentials
elsewhere - Claude Code has its own `claude auth login`, Anthropic takes a
key - and the third, xFormat, takes an email and a password. The TUI let a
person select it and gave them nowhere to sign in, so the only ways to make
the setting mean anything were the desktop window or `xanalyze ai login`.
A setting whose one prerequisite lives on another surface is a setting that
lies about what it does.

What this file holds to, beyond "the screen exists":

* **The password is spent, not kept.** It is cleared from the widget before
  the call is even made, and nothing writes it anywhere. That is the same
  contract `ui/sign_in_dialog.py` and `cli_impl.aicmds.cmd_ai_login` keep,
  and it is the reason this screen is allowed to exist while an API-key
  field still deliberately is not: a key is a secret that must be *kept*.
* **The network call is off the UI thread.** On a captive network a
  synchronous sign-in is thirty seconds of a frozen interface.
* **The other two providers are told where their sign-in actually is**,
  rather than being offered a form that cannot work.
