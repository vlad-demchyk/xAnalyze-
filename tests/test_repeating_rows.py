"""A row that repeats the one above it has to say what it is about.

A page with twenty images in an old format produced twenty rows reading
"Image with no dimensions set" and nothing else. The `src` that tells them
apart was in the finding and was not on the row, so the list said the same
thing twenty times - and the comment in `audit_panel.py` had already
written down why that is bad: a list where every row repeats the previous
one is a list nobody reads to the bottom.

Grouping is not the fix, and that was the first thing checked. Twenty images
are twenty different problems; merging them would lose which images, since
`places_of` reports the document and every one of them is on the same page.
The grouping was right. The row was under-informative.

So the distinguishing value is taken from the fields the rule's own
sentences interpolate - the value the explanation would have shown anyway,
rather than a second vocabulary invented for the list - and only when the
title actually repeats, because putting it on every row of every rule is how
a list stops being scannable in the other direction.

Headless: Qt runs on the offscreen platform, like the other widget tests.
