"""The window learns what a folder is, and says so.

Two gaps this closes, both of which existed because `xanalyze audit` knew
something the desktop app did not.

**The exclusions.** `cli_impl.scanning._build_ignore_list` has applied the
detected stack's exclusions since `project_profile` existed; the window
applied only the flat default list. So the same WordPress folder produced
hundreds of findings in vendored `wp-includes/` from the window and none
from the CLI - findings against code the person cannot change, burying the
ones they can.

**The medium.** `--medium` has been on `audit` and `fullscan`; the window
had no way to say "these are emails". On an email the browser-only checks -
canonical, Open Graph, structured data, skip link, landmarks - are category
errors, and in one real workspace they were the six loudest rules of 1074
findings.

Neither is applied silently. A profile is evidence about ownership, and
evidence can be wrong: what it decided is on screen with its own reasons,
and it can be lifted.
