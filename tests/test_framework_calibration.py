"""One pair of files per technology: correct code, and broken code.

This is the harness the tool did not have. Every exclusion and every mask it
carries was added after a false-positive class turned up in somebody's
project - `.tsx` skipped for two months (`P-19`), PHP server tags read as
having no text, `#` in an attribute treated as a comment, 455 findings from
vendored WordPress core. Each was found by a person looking at a real report,
which means the next framework fails the same way until someone looks again.

So each technology gets two fixtures that differ in exactly one thing: one is
written the way its framework says to write it, the other is not.

* the **correct** file must produce **no findings**. A finding there is the
  tool not understanding the framework.
* the **broken** file must produce the findings it deserves. Silence there is
  the tool blind, which is the more expensive failure - a scan that reports
  nothing reads as a clean one.

Two whole-framework defects were found by writing this file, and neither was
visible in any real report:

* Vue, Angular, Alpine, Svelte and Thymeleaf bind attributes by *renaming*
  them -
  `:alt="caption"`, `[attr.alt]`, `x-bind:alt`. The plain attribute is then
  absent, so a correct component was reported as missing its `alt`. See
  `audit.base.resolve_bound_attributes`.
* BeautifulSoup hides text inside `<template>` the way it hides a comment,
  and a Vue single-file component *is* a `<template>`. Every label, link and
  heading inside one read as empty. See `audit.base.unwrap_template_text`.

* An element whose text arrives at runtime - `x-text`, `v-text`, `th:text`,
  `ng-bind`, `data-i18n` - is written empty on purpose, and read literally it
  is an empty link with no accessible name. See
  `audit.base.resolve_text_directives`.
* A `.html` file with no `<html>` in it is a *template*, not a page. An
  Angular component template collected eight page-level findings -
  `bp-charset`, `landmark-regions`, `skip-link`, `seo-canonical` - for not
  being a document it was never going to be. See
  `audit.engine._document_kind`.

Before those fixes the idiomatic Vue component and the deliberately broken one
produced identical findings - three each - which means the pass could not
tell them apart at all.
