"""`corpus/foreign.jsonl` against the two claims that were made about it.

The claims are numbers, so they are held here rather than in a comment: a
marker added to `lang_detect` for one language can quietly cost another, and
the wording pass going quiet outside its lists is worth exactly as much as
the count of entries it stays quiet on.

The entries are paragraphs from dated 2018 Wikipedia revisions in five
languages this tool has no lists for - human by date, and rebuildable with
`scripts/fetch_foreign_corpus.py`.
