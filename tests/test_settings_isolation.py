"""The suite must not be able to write the person's own settings.

This is the case `P-13` existed for. `config.CONFIG_FILE` used to be a module
constant resolved during import, so `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set by a test came too
late and `Settings.save()` always landed on the real
`~/.config/xanalyze/settings.json`. Two tests found that out by damage rather
than by failure - one flipped the developer's auto-start toggle on disk, one
passed only because their `ui_language` happened to be `en` - and the fix was
copy-pasted per test as `window.settings.save = lambda: None`.

The mechanism is now `config.config_file()` plus `tests/conftest.py`. These
cases assert the mechanism itself, because a mechanism nobody checks is how
the constant came back last time.
