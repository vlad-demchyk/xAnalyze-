"""Three defects that only a run of the built application could show.

None of them fails a unit test, and all three were found by building the
bundles and using them:

1. **The browser pass was invisible in the window.** Its findings are merged
   into the documents after the list on screen was built, and nothing
   repainted. Measured on one page: 12 rows against 31 findings - axe,
   HTML_CodeSniffer, the state pass and every load measurement present in
   the result and none of them displayed. The CLI never had it because it
   prints after the merge.

2. **The report language of an Italian site came out English.** Every block
   voted, and a navigation label is one or two words: on a site whose prose
   is 9:2 Italian the vote was 23 `en` to 19 `it`. The advice that names a
   better detector for Italian is chosen by that answer, so it never
   reached an Italian reader either.

3. **`--version` opened the window.** The Makefile tells whoever builds the
   bundle to verify it with `XAnalyze.app/Contents/MacOS/XAnalyze
   --version`; that sat there with a window open instead of printing, on the
   surface where a stale binary is hardest to notice.

The fourth, `multiprocessing.freeze_support()`, is not here: it is only
observable in a frozen binary, where a child process re-executes the
bundle's own argv. `tests/test_bundle_entry.py` covers what can be covered
from source - that the call exists and runs before anything else.
