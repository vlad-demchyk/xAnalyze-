"""Where run folders land, and what happened to the ones already written.

Changed 2026-09-02 at the owner's request: `~/Documents/XAnalyze` rather
than `~/Desktop/XAnalyze`. A run leaves a folder per target and a sub-folder
per run inside it, so what accumulates is an archive - and an archive on the
Desktop is in front of everything else all day.

The half worth testing is not the new path but the old one. Changing a
default silently strands the data written under it: the runs panel empties,
and the second run of a target has nothing to compare against because its
history is somewhere the code no longer looks. So the move is part of the
change, and it has exactly one rule - never over an existing destination,
because merging two roots would have to silently pick between two runs of
the same target in the same minute.
