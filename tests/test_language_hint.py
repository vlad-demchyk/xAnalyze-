"""What the two entry points tag a block with, and why it is not "en".

`lang_detect` has two answers for "I could not read this": `None` means the
passage is too short to tell, and `UNSUPPORTED` means it is a language with
no lists here. The whole point of `None` is that it makes a caller check
every list instead of one - `_cliche_hits` implements exactly that, and the
docstrings in `lang_detect` argue for it at length.

It was dead on both live paths. `crawler` and `repo_scanner` tagged blocks
with `guess_language`, which turns `None` into `"en"`, so nothing downstream
ever saw the answer the mechanism was built for. Measured 2026-08-31 on a
live Italian page: 29 of 71 blocks arrived tagged `en` while
`guess_language_safe` said `None`, and on the corpus 232 entries carried the
wrong tag - 116 of them Italian.
