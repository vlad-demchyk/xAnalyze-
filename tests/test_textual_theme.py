"""The TUI's colours, generated from the same `Palette` the Qt window paints
with, rather than typed into a `.tcss` file by hand a second time.

`build_qss` (tested in `tests/test_palette_contrast.py` and elsewhere)
already exists as the model: a style sheet generated from tokens instead of
hand-maintained, so a token change stays a one-line change upstream instead
of a hunt through two GUIs. `build_textual_theme` is that same idea for
Textual, and the thing worth pinning down is that it actually *is* the same
idea - the values a `Theme` hands the TUI have to be the values `Palette`
computed, not Textual's own derivation of them from a base hue, or the two
front ends drift apart within the first token change.

The second thing pinned down here is the named risk in the TUI rework: a
16- or 256-colour terminal cannot show the muted palette's exact hexes, and
assuming the desktop contrast numbers survive that downgrade is a guess, not
a measurement. `rich.color.Color.downgrade` is what Textual itself uses to
pick a terminal's actual output colour, so measuring after that call is
measuring what a person would in fact see.
