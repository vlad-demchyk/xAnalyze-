"""`fullscan` writes the styled report it says it writes.

Measured 2026-09-02: it did not. `_styled_report_model` read `args` - a name
it never received - and every writer call is wrapped in `try/except` so the
run kept going and printed one line about it:

    # warning: styled report failed: name 'args' is not defined

So every `fullscan` since `2460da7` (2026-09-01) produced no PDF and no HTML,
on every target, and the suite stayed green through twelve commits: nothing
asserted that the file exists, only that the writer was called.

That is what this file asserts, and it asserts it the only way that could
have caught it - by running the real command and looking on disk. The report
folder is a temporary directory, not the Desktop default, so the test does
not write into wherever the person running it keeps their reports.
