"""`corpus/negative_pool.jsonl`: the shortest register a scan ever meets.

`P-35`: 292 human interface lines sat in `corpus/` without entering a single
calibration number - `scripts/calibrate.py` reads `labelled.jsonl`,
`EmbeddingDetector` reads the tune half of that same file, `scripts/gate.py`
asks the same question of the same rows, and `corpus/README.md` did not name
this file at all. A corpus file nobody reads is not a negative set; it is a
file.

Measured 2026-09-01, and the measurement is what decides its role:

* **0 of 292** cross the reporting threshold in the wording pass;
* **no entry reaches five words** (the longest is four), so
  `EmbeddingDetector` - which refuses anything shorter - can never return a
  span here, and `guess_language_safe` answers `None` rather than a language;
* merging it into `labelled.jsonl` would therefore add nothing the embedding
  detector can read, while restating every ratio measured on that file and
  making these lines a *component* of the detector they are meant to judge
  (see the "Half of this file is a detector" section of `corpus/README.md`).

So it stays a yardstick, like `prose.jsonl` and `promotional.jsonl`, and the
numbers live here rather than in a comment: this is the register where a
cliché list is cheapest to break silently, because one wrong entry flags a
menu on every page of a site at once.
