"""The method combo has to decide what actually runs.

This file exists because of one bug, and the bug was not a crash: the window
offered "offline / AI / both", normalised the choice, reported it in the
status bar - and then started every copy pass with whatever detector a
*second* combo happened to name. Choosing AI ran the offline engine and
presented its findings as the model's answer. Nothing failed, so nothing
said anything.

So these tests assert the connection itself, not the shape of the widgets:
what `MainWindow._detector_for_request` hands to the worker, for each method.

Headless: Qt runs on the offscreen platform.
