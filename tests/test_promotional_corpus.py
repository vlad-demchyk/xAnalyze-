"""`corpus/promotional.jsonl`: human writing whose job is to make you want
something.

Every human entry this project had was one of three registers - interface
strings, documentation, encyclopedic paragraphs - and a scan is pointed at
none of them. `P-03` said so and `P-06` measured the cost on a live Italian
hotel page: the offline pass found nothing there, and the reason was not the
language label or the length ceiling but that the Italian lists do not hold
what promotional copy is made of.

Adding what they lack is a two-sided change, and until this file existed only
one side could be counted. `nel cuore di` is not evidence of a model - it is
how a person writes about a town square - so a list that gains a phrase
without a promotional yardstick has traded precision for recall in the dark.

Dated Wikivoyage revisions are that yardstick: a travel guide is marketing
writing by function, and a MediaWiki revision id makes "a person wrote this,
and it is dated" checkable per row rather than asserted.

Measured 2026-08-31, the first time this file existed: **four** of these human
paragraphs crossed the reporting threshold. Three on a single word each, one
on a structural pattern. All four causes were counted on both sides and
removed; held-out recall did not move (en 11/20, it 4/11, uk 10/14) and false
alarms on this register went **4 to 0**.
