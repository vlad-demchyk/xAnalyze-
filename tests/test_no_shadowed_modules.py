"""A parameter must not take the name of a module the file imports.

Measured 2026-09-02, on a live site: `cli_impl.auditpass` imported `progress`
and `_audit_at_widths` had a parameter called `progress`. Inside that
function `progress.notice(...)` therefore meant "call `.notice` on the
callback", and the browser pass died with

    the browser pass failed: 'function' object has no attribute 'notice'

The suite was green through it, because every test that reaches that code
path mocks `_audit_at_widths` - so the one function where the two names met
was the one function never executed. Only a real run found it.

This is the general form of that, and it is cheap: read every module, list
what it imports at the top level, and fail on any function whose parameters
or assignments reuse one of those names. Shadowing is legal Python and
usually harmless; it is harmless right up to the first attribute access, and
by then the failure is somewhere else entirely.
