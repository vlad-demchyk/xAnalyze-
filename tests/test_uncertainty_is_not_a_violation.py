"""An engine that cannot decide must not outrank one that found something.

Both vendored engines report "I could not work this out" through the same
channel as a confirmed failure, and both were arriving at full weight.

* HTML_CodeSniffer's contrast check emits `.Abs` - "this element is
  absolutely positioned and the background color can not be determined" - as
  a *serious* violation. On ten pages of `https://www.gov.uk/`, 60 of 61
  `1_4_3` findings were that; on ten pages of the Palmanova site, 93 of 103.

* axe puts a result in `incomplete` precisely when it cannot decide, and the
  entry still carries the `impact` of a real failure. That made "Unable to
  determine if aria-controls referenced ID exists" a *critical*. Checked
  against the live page: all five `aria-controls` targets exist.

GOV.UK is the control that makes the size of this obvious. A pass reporting
605 serious accessibility failures across ten pages of the site whose focus
and contrast states are among the most tested on the web is describing
itself, not the site.
