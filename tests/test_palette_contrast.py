"""The app's own palette, held to the rule the app enforces on other people.

XAnalyze reports insufficient contrast as an accessibility finding on the
pages it audits (`audit.rules.accessibility.InlineContrast`). Its own window
was never measured against the same threshold, and "the dark theme has uneven
spots" is not a defect anyone can act on - so this file turns that sentence
into numbers, using the very function the audit rule uses.

Every pair below is a foreground the window actually paints on a background
it actually paints it on, in both themes. Three of them failed when this was
first run, which is what `Palette.error_strong` / `error_text` /
`success_text` exist to fix:

    white on `error`      3.91  the HIGH badge, 12px bold - not "large text"
    `success` on `bg`     3.34  the "signed in" line in Settings
    `error` on `bg`       3.91  the same line in its failure state

WCAG AA is 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text and for the visual
boundary of a control. Where 3:1 is the right threshold that is said per
pair, with the reason - never as a way of letting a failing pair pass.

#: the dark one. It is xFormat's own `--border-strong`, and every button it
#: draws is identified by its label or its icon - both of which clear AA by a

#: Stepping them to 4.5:1 was tried first and is what this replaces. The cost
#: was not the hue: on these surfaces the band above 4.5:1 is narrow enough
#: that all three tiers arrived at the same grey, so `#8b877f`, `#a8a49c` and
#: `#7d7a73` became one colour and the hierarchy the design is read by - a
#: label quieter than a value, a caret quieter than a label - stopped
#: existing. Three tiers that can be told apart were judged worth more than
#: three that pass and cannot.
#:
#: Pinned rather than skipped: the ratios below are asserted exactly, so a
#: token that drifts still fails this file and the exception has to be taken
