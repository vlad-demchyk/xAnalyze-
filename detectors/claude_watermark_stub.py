"""Unavailable wiring point for Anthropic's official text-watermark API.

Anthropic's announcement, updated 1 September 2026 and reviewed 14 October,
confirms a private preview for eligible organizations. This application has
neither an approved access contract nor an implemented endpoint. A general
Anthropic API key does not establish watermark access.

Source: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-text-watermark
The signal concerns Claude involvement, not general AI/human authorship.
It remains separate from stylistic classifiers and hidden-character checks.
