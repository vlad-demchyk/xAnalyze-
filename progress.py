"""The run as it happens, in a shape an agent can read while it happens.

`--json` answers only at the end. On a thirty-page site that is minutes of
silence, and the thing driving the CLI cannot tell a slow crawl from a hung
one. The human lines on stderr (`# [crawl 3/30] depth=1 …`) were readable
but were never a contract: no schema, no event type, and no promise the
wording would survive the next edit.

`--progress jsonl` turns those same points into one JSON object per line on
stderr. **The same points**, not a second set: every call here prints either
the human line or the object, from one call site with one set of values, so
the two cannot drift into describing different runs. Without the flag
nothing changes - the human line is what gets printed, byte for byte what it
was before.

Every object carries `event` (one of `EVENTS`) and `ts` (UTC, ISO 8601).
`finding` is off unless asked for (`--progress jsonl=findings`): a large site
produces tens of thousands of them, and a progress stream that is mostly
findings is a report, not progress.

Like `applog`, nothing here may break a run: every public function swallows
its own errors. A progress stream that can kill a scan is worse than none.
