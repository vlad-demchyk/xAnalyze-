"""Putting the frozen `xanalyze` command on the user's `PATH`.

Only meaningful for a packaged macOS build — running from source, `python
cli.py` already *is* the command. Modeled on VS Code's "Shell Command:
Install 'code' command in PATH": one button, one symlink, no installer
package.

There is only one frozen executable (`packaging/XAnalyze.spec` builds it
from `app_entry.py`, not `main.py`/`cli.py` directly) — the GUI and the CLI
are the same binary, told apart at runtime by the name it was invoked as
(see `app_entry.py`). So "installing the CLI" is just symlinking that one
executable under the name `app_entry.py` looks for, `xanalyze` — no second
copy, no separate build artifact.

Two things make macOS special here, both because the app ships unsigned (no
Developer ID yet — see `manual-todo.md`):

* A `.dmg` download tags every file it contains with the `com.apple.quarantine`
  extended attribute. Approving the GUI once (right-click -> Open) only
  clears Gatekeeper's opinion of *that* invocation; running the same binary
  directly from a terminal afterward, under the new name, can still hit its
  own "unidentified developer" refusal unless the attribute is stripped
  explicitly — see `_clear_quarantine`.
* There is no postinstall hook to do this automatically (a plain drag-to-
  Applications `.dmg` has no script step), so it has to be a deliberate,
  user-triggered action — the button this module backs.
