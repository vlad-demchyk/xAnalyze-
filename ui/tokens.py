"""The bridge to xFormat's design system.

The web app, the landing page and the admin console all take their colours,
radii, spacing and type scale from one file — `apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css`
in the `XFormat` repository. This module reads that same file and turns it
into plain Python values, so the desktop app is styled from the design
system rather than from a second, drifting copy of it.

Where the file is looked for, in order:

1. `$XFORMAT_TOKENS_CSS`, when set — point it anywhere.
2. The sibling checkout: `../XFormat/apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css`
   relative to this repository. This is the live file, so a token changed
   in the frontend shows up in the desktop app on the next launch.
3. `ui/design/xformat-tokens.css` — a vendored snapshot, so the app still
   starts (and still looks like xFormat) on a machine that only has this
   repository checked out.

Only the parts of CSS that actually appear in the token file are supported:
custom properties, `var(--x)` references (resolved recursively, with the
fallback form `var(--x, y)`), `rem` lengths, and the two theme scopes
(`:root` for light, `[data-theme="dark"]` for dark). `color-mix()` is
computed for the `in srgb` form used by the file; anything else that can't
be resolved is dropped rather than guessed, and every consumer below reads
tokens through `Palette`, which has a hard-coded fallback for each value it
needs. A malformed or missing token file therefore degrades to a plain but
correct theme instead of failing to start.
