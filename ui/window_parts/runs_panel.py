"""The catalogue of runs: what is on disk, and what can be continued.

A full scan of a large site is a three-quarter-hour job, and it can stop for
reasons that have nothing to do with the target - a wedged renderer, a laptop
closing, someone wanting their machine back. Before this the interface had no
idea any of that had happened: a stopped run was simply gone, and the only
evidence was a folder in Documents nobody was told about.

The list is built by walking the run folders, the same walk `xanalyze runs`
does, and not from a registry the interface keeps of its own. One fact, one
owner: a registry would be a second answer to "what runs exist", it would be
the one that went stale the moment a folder was moved by hand, and the CLI and
the GUI would then disagree about the same disk.

Artboard 3c turns it from a list into a table, and the reason is the action
column. A row used to carry Resume and Pause side by side, and one of the two
was always wrong for it - a finished run cannot be paused and a running one
cannot be resumed, so half the buttons on screen existed to be refused. Now
each row offers the one thing its state actually allows, spelled as a word,
and everything else moves behind a "..." menu. What a row can do is a
property of the row, not a fixed pair of controls repeated down the column.
