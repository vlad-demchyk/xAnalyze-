#: shows it in full.
_COMBO_CHARS = 10

#: The height of the top controls row when it fits on one line. Not a width
#: any more: the controls used to be a 268px column beside the results, and
#: are now a strip above them, so what they cost the body is height. The row
#: wraps to a second line rather than forcing the window wider - see
#: `_build_ui` - which is why this is what it fits into, not what it demands.
#:
#: The design draws this row at 44px, from a 28px control inside 8px of
#: padding. Qt reaches 52px at the same paddings, because its buttons and
#: labels are taller than the browser's at the same font size. Measured
#: rather than decreed: trimming the padding to land on 44 would distort the
#: design's spacing to pay for a difference in font metrics.

# own minimum width doesn't read as staying - it reads as broken. Columns
