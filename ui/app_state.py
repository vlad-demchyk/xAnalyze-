"""Centralized application state with change notifications.

AppState holds every user-facing choice (source, reader, check, method,
provider) and emits Qt signals when any of them change. The toolbar
combos write to this object; the UI subscribes to its signals to
update visibility, enabled state, and combo contents.

This replaces the scattered ``self.source``, ``self._chosen_checks()``,
``self._chosen_methods()`` etc. that lived directly on MainWindow.
