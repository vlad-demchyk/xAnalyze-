    Local targets get this through the ordinary scan; a crawled page never
    was a file, so the detector runs over its text blocks here and the spans
    become the finding dicts the reports read. Without this, a website scan
    silently lost whole report sections a repo scan had.

    **`--detector` reaches this.** It did not, and that was the whole of the
    AI mode on the path most people use: this hardcoded the offline engine, so
    `fullscan https://site --detector llm-judge` crawled the site, said
    nothing, and ran the free heuristic. The flag was accepted, reported
    nowhere, and did nothing - the failure mode this project keeps finding,
    where a control looks like it works because nothing raises.

    The character pass stays offline whatever was asked for. It is exact and
    free, a model has nothing to add to "this is an en dash", and paying a
    judge to re-answer it would be a cost with no result.

    The same threshold as the repo scan, and this is not a detail. Without it
    this path appended *every* span the detector produced, scored or not: a
    real 192-page run reported 10,976 "AI text patterns" of which 10,946 were
    `low` - blocks that scored 0.00 and were listed anyway. They inflated the
    count the user reads, and they are most of why that run's artifacts came
    to 14 MB of JSON, 31 MB of HTML and a 117 MB PDF.

    Character findings are kept at any confidence, exactly as the repo scan
    keeps them: a wrong dash is a fact about the text, so a low score there
    means "a small defect", not "probably nothing". A style score below the
    threshold means the second thing, and saying it 10,946 times says nothing.

    **`args.repo`**, when given, adds `source_file`/`source_line` to a
    finding whose passage matches a block found under that path - the actual
    place to fix it, not just the page it renders on. This is additive: a
    site given without `--repo` behaves exactly as before, because most runs
    have no checkout to point at and are not made worse for lacking one.
    `stats_out`, when given, receives `{"repo_matched", "repo_total"}` over
    every distinct passage on the site, not only the ones that produced a
    finding - "how much of this site the given checkout explains" is a
