"""`runs`, `resume` and `pause`: the catalogue of runs and what to do with one.

A full scan of a large site is a long job that can stop for reasons that have
nothing to do with the target - a wedged renderer, a laptop closing, a person
deciding they want their machine back. These three commands exist so stopping
is not the same as losing: the catalogue says what state every run is in, and
one command continues any of them.

`resume` re-enters `cmd_fullscan` with the recorded invocation rather than
reimplementing the phases. That is the whole reason the argv is stored: a
resume that rebuilt the arguments from the state file would be a second answer
to "what run is this", and it would be the one that drifted.
