"""What this run is about to do, and what it is about to leave undone.

A scan takes what it was given and reports what it found. Two of the most
useful things this tool can do are not defaults and were never mentioned:

* a **site** audited without `--repo` reports the page a problem is on, and
  cannot say which file to open - the repository behind it was never asked
  for;
* a **repository** scanned without `--devserver` is read as source, so every
  rule that needs a rendered page (contrast, focus order, layout at a
  breakpoint, the measurements) simply does not run - and the project may
  be one command away from serving itself.

Neither is a defect in the run. Both are the difference between a shallow
answer and a deep one, and the person or the agent that started the run is
the only one who can decide. So they are said before the work starts, in a
line an agent can match on and a person can read, and the run continues
either way: this is a notice, not a prompt, because a scan that blocks on a
question cannot be put in a pipeline.

`--no-hints` silences them. Nothing here changes what is measured.
