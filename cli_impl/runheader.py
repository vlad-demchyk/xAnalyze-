"""What a document says about the run that produced it.

Every report in this tool describes findings and, until now, said almost
nothing about *how they were obtained*. Two reports on the same site can
differ by a factor of three because one ran the browser and the other did
not, one read the whole repository and the other stopped at a file limit,
one asked for `--confidence exact` and the other took everything. A reader
comparing them, or checking one months later, had no way to tell which run
they were holding.

So each document opens with the command, the target and the parameters that
changed what was measured. Only those: `--report` and `--styled-report` say
where the file went, not what is in it, and listing them would pad the line
that has to stay readable.
