"""Entry point: python main.py

Thin on purpose. This file used to carry a second, simplified `MainWindow`
of its own - a redesign that became the entry point in `31fe7f2` and left
`ui/main_window.py` orphaned. The consequences were not cosmetic: that
window drove the analysis workers directly instead of going through
`ui.view_model`, so the accessibility audit never ran (it computed
`wants_audit` and never read it), the scope and method chosen in its sidebar
never reached the scan, and report export, fix-on-disk, undo, bulk rewrite
and the preview highlight did not exist. Every UI test in the suite was
meanwhile exercising the window nobody launched.

There is one window again, it is the complete one, and its controls now live
in a left-hand column - the shape the redesign was reaching for. See
`ui.main_window.SIDEBAR_WIDTH`.

    not have and does not want. Why at all: the frozen binary already *is*
    the CLI and the TUI (`app_entry.py` tells the roles apart by the name it
    was invoked as), so someone who never finds the button in Settings has
    two of the three surfaces sitting in the bundle, unreachable.
