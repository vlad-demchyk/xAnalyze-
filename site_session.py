"""Where a signed-in browser session for a site is kept, and who may read it.

Half of what is worth auditing is behind a login, and the only way in that
does not involve this tool handling anybody's credentials is the obvious one:
a person signs in themselves, in a real browser window, and the run reuses
what that browser was given. QtWebEngine stores that for us - a named,
persistent profile with `ForcePersistentCookies` is the same mechanism a
browser profile is - so this module is only about *where* it lives, *whose*
it is, and how to get rid of it.

Three rules, and none of them is optional:

* **Nothing here ever reaches a report, a log or a run folder.** What a
  document may say is "this run was signed in as a session for host X". The
  values are the session; printing them is handing the session over.
* **One profile per host.** A session for `staging.example.com` has no
  business travelling to `example.com`, and a single shared profile would
  mean the last site signed into decides who the next scan is.
* **It can be forgotten, and the person can see that it exists.** A tool
  that quietly keeps a way into somebody's account is not a tool anybody
  should install. `forget()` is the whole answer, and `known_hosts()` is how
  a surface shows what there is to forget.

**No credentials are stored, ever.** This tool never sees a password: the
sign-in happens in the browser window, against the site's own form, and what
survives is what the site chose to give that browser.
