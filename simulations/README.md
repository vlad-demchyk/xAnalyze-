# Simulations

Test fixtures for XAnalyze. Each folder contains HTML files with specific issues.

## Folders

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| `ai-text/` | AI-generated content with clichés and structural patterns |
| `bad-accessibility/` | WCAG violations: missing alt, labels, contrast, headings |
| `bad-viewport/` | Responsive issues: fixed widths, small text, tiny touch targets |
| `bad-seo/` | SEO problems: missing title, meta, canonical, structured data |
| `bad-performance/` | Performance issues: render-blocking, large images, sync scripts |
| `mixed-problems/` | Combination of all issues |
| `good-site/` | Clean site with no issues (control) |

## Usage

```bash
# Test all simulations
xanalyze fullscan simulations/ --json
