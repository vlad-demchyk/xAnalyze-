"""Evidence that a render is still working, instead of a clock.

A fixed print ceiling and no ceiling at all are the same design error seen
from two sides, and this project shipped both in turn:

* 30 seconds killed a 158-page report that finished in 108 when left alone.
  The run had already spent 46 minutes crawling and auditing, and wrote
  nothing at all.
* `RENDER_TIMEOUT_MS = 0` fixed that by removing the ceiling - and with it
  the floor. A render process that dies now hangs the writer forever, with
  no entry in any log.

Elapsed time was never the thing worth measuring. A render that has been
going for ten minutes and is still consuming CPU is healthy; one that has
been silent for forty seconds with a dead render process is not, and the
elapsed time does not distinguish them. So this watches for *progress* and
stops on *its absence*, which is a different question with a different answer.

Three sources of evidence, in the order they are trusted:

1. **The render process died.** `renderProcessTerminated` is Qt answering,
   and the answer will not change on a retry.
2. **Load progress moved.** Only meaningful while loading; `printToPdf`
   emits nothing, which is exactly why the third source exists.
3. **The render process used more CPU than at the last poll.** This is the
   only progress signal available during printing. Read with `ps`, because
   the alternative is a new dependency for one number.

When no pid is available, or `ps` will not answer, the watch says so in its
reason rather than quietly degrading into the fixed timer this module exists
to replace.
