Kept as one function here rather than duplicated in the CLI and the window

HTML, or render it to PDF first" is exactly the kind of one-line decision
that drifts apart if it is written twice.

    **A failed PDF is not a failed report.** Printing is the last step of a

    Markdown report is already written. So a render failure does not
    propagate: a one-page stand-in is written to `path` instead, saying where
    the Markdown report is and carrying the headline numbers. The person opens
    the file they expected and is redirected in one line, rather than finding
    no PDF and no explanation.

    `markdown_path` is what that stand-in points at. Without it the notice
    still says the report is in the same folder, which is true - but naming
    the file is the difference between a redirect and a hint.
