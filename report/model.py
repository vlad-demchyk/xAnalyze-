"""The one shape `template.py` renders from.

Two very different analyses feed a styled report — the AI-text pass
(`AnalysisResult` / `RepoAnalysisResult`, scoring `TextSpan`s as a
probability) and the site audit (`AccessibilityResult`, reporting `Issue`s
as facts with a severity). They disagree about almost everything: one has a
0..1 score and a detector name, the other has a fixed severity vocabulary
and a WCAG reference. Rather than let the template know both, each source
gets its own adapter function here (`from_text_analysis` /
`from_accessibility`) that flattens it into one `ReportModel` of
`ReportFinding`s. The template — and the PDF renderer behind it — reads only
that, so it has exactly one shape to lay out regardless of which mode
produced it.

        half had been protected against exactly this since the function was
        written.

        The rule id joins it now that the document *prints* the rule id.
