"""Colour as information: which element a finding is about, and which half
of a diff you are reading.

The styled report quoted markup as one undifferentiated grey block. That is
readable but not *legible*: on a page of forty findings the eye has nothing
to sort by, and the two code blocks under a finding - the markup that is
wrong and the markup that would fix it - looked identical, so the reader had
to parse both to learn which was which.

Two colour systems, deliberately kept apart, because they answer different
questions and mixing them makes a rainbow that means nothing:

**Elements are coloured by role, not by name.** A hash of the tag name would
give every tag its own hue and no hue any meaning. Six roles instead - a
landmark, an interactive control, a grouping wrapper, media, running text,
document metadata - so a reader who has seen three findings has already
learnt the scheme, and `<button>` and `<a>` share an ink because they share a
problem space. Unknown tags fall to the grouping ink rather than to a
seventh colour: a custom element is a wrapper until something says otherwise.

**Diff direction is red and green, and nothing else is.** The design bundle
draws exactly this (artboard 3a, the `−`/`+` pair under a finding), and it
only works while red and green mean *before* and *after* and never also mean
"a media tag". So the role inks below are chosen from the rest of the
palette: the reserved two are not among them.

Every value comes from `ui.tokens.Palette` - the XAnalyze desktop palette,
which is the design bundle read as tokens - and never from a hex typed here.
