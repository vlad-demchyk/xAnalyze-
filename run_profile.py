"""What the target implies about how to read it.

`project_profile` answers *what a directory is*. This module answers the
question that follows and that nothing asked before: **so what should this
run do differently?**

Until now the answer lived nowhere. The window drew a "Project profile"
card that named the stack and changed nothing; the terminal form offered the
same eleven controls for a URL, a folder and a single `.html` file, most of
which were dead for two of the three. A person had to know that
`--web-parts` needs a checkout, that `--depth` means nothing to a folder,
and that a Vite app scanned off disk is markup a bundler has not run yet.
That is knowledge the tool has and was making the person supply.

Two rules hold this honest, and they are the same two that hold
`project_profile` honest:

**Nothing is enabled silently.** Every suggestion carries the stack that
asked for it and the marker file that proved that stack, so "enabled, because
…" is a sentence a surface can print and a person can disagree with. A
suggestion is applied only to an option the person has not touched -
`apply` takes the set of options they set by hand and never overwrites one.

**A field is hidden only when it reaches nothing.** `fields_for` is derived
from what each option needs, not from a per-screen list: a crawl depth needs
pages to crawl, `--incremental` needs files on disk with mtimes. Hiding
anything else would be tidying, and tidying is how a control that mattered
became unreachable - which is the defect this whole module is a reaction to.
