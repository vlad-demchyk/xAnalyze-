"""The log the app keeps about itself.

A user reporting "the scan found nothing" hands over a screenshot of a
finished window. What actually happened - which pages were fetched, which
engine refused to start, which rule raised, how long the browser pass took -
lived in stderr, and stderr is gone by the time anyone asks. This is the
file that survives the run.

**Written as JSON Lines, one file per day.** Both halves of that matter. A
record is a dict, so a viewer can filter by level or by run without parsing
prose, and a day per file makes retention a matter of deleting files rather
than rewriting one. `xanalyze-2026-08-27.log`.

**It never raises.** Every public function swallows its own errors: a log
that can break a scan is worse than no log at all, and the one thing this
must not do is become the reason a run fails.

**It cleans up after itself**, because a debug log that fills a disk gets
switched off and then it helps nobody. Two limits, both enforced together
and both deliberately conservative:

* files older than `RETENTION_DAYS` are removed, and
* whatever is left is trimmed to `MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`, oldest first.

Cleanup runs once per process, on the first write, rather than on every
call: the cost is a directory listing, and paying it per log line would make
logging expensive enough to think twice about - which is how logging stops
being added.

Read it with `xanalyze logs` (CLI), the Logs screen in the TUI, or the log
panel in the window. All three call `read_records` here, so what they show
is the same list in a different frame.
