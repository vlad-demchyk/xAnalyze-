"""Ignoring findings you have already decided about.

Any detector that flags style will be wrong sometimes, and some of what it
gets right will still be wanted: a company whose product genuinely is
"comprehensive" does not need that word underlined on every page forever. A
tool with no way to say "not this one" gets switched off entirely, so the
suppression list is part of the detector, not an afterthought.

Five levels, from the most surgical to the broadest, because they answer
different questions:

* **fingerprint** — "this exact finding, here, is fine." Survives a
  re-scan, and only this one.
* **phrase** — "never flag this word or phrase at all." For house style.
* **rule** — "switch this check off." A signal (`cliches`, `dashes`), a
  character category (`typography`), or an accessibility rule id
  (`link-text-vague`). One namespace on purpose: the user thinks in terms
  of "the check that keeps bothering me", not in terms of which subsystem
  it came from.
* **path** — "not in this file or on this URL." gitignore-style patterns
  and URL globs — generated files, a vendored theme, a staging domain.
* **selector** — "not inside this part of the page." CSS selectors, which
  is also exactly the shape `axe.run({exclude})` takes, so one list drives
  both the text analysis and the accessibility engine rather than two.

Where the list lives:

1. `Settings.ignore` — the user's own, across every project.
2. `.xanalyze-ignore` in the scanned folder — the project's own, committed
   alongside the code so a team shares one decision instead of each member
   re-dismissing the same finding.

Both are read; neither overrides the other. That is deliberate: a personal
"I never want this" and a project's "we decided this is fine" are both
true at once, and making one win would silently discard a decision.
