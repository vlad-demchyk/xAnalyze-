"""Same-domain page crawler with a configurable link-depth limit.

Depth semantics:
  depth=0  -> only the given URL is fetched.
  depth=1  -> the given URL plus every same-domain page it links to.
  depth=N  -> follow links N hops away from the root URL.

Only same-domain links are followed so the crawl can't wander off the
target site. A hard page-count cap protects against accidentally crawling
a huge site.

## Why a page can come back empty

This crawler makes one plain HTTP request per page and reads the HTML that
comes back. It runs no JavaScript — there is no browser in the loop, by
design: rendering every page would turn a fast scan into a slow one and
pull a headless browser into the dependency list. The cost of that choice
is that several very different situations all end in "no text found", and
telling them apart is not something the user can do by looking at an empty
list.

So every page carries a `PageDiagnostics` record explaining which of these
happened:

* `js-rendered` — the response is an application shell (`<div id="root">`
  and a bundle) and the copy is written into the DOM by the browser. This
  is the single most common cause, and nothing here can fix it; the honest
  answer is "point the scanner at the rendered HTML, or at the repository
  that produces it" (repository mode exists partly for this).
* `blocked` — the server answered, but with a bot check or a consent wall
  rather than the page. Detectable by status code, or by a body that is all
  markup and no copy.
* `not-html` — a PDF, an image, a JSON endpoint. Previously these vanished
  from the result list entirely, which read as "crawled, nothing found".
* `too-short` — real copy was extracted, but every block was under
  `MIN_BLOCK_LEN`. Common on navigation-only pages and link hubs.
* `no-text` — the markup genuinely has no text nodes worth reading.
* `error` — the request failed outright (DNS, TLS, timeout, 5xx).

Text extraction itself also gained a fallback: copy that sits directly in a
`<div>` or `<section>`, with no paragraph tag around it, used to be missed
entirely because those tags aren't in `CANDIDATE_TAGS` — and adding them as
ordinary candidates would capture every wrapper element's concatenated
text. `_leaf_container_blocks` picks up only containers whose own direct
text is the copy, which keeps the wrappers out.

    render, if given, is called as render(url) and returns the DOM a browser
    built, or "" when it could not. It is injected rather than imported so the
    crawler keeps no opinion about which browser, and stays importable without
    Qt: the walk is the crawler's job, and rendering is one way of reading a
    page. `config.render_mode` decides when it is called at all.

    walk, if given, is a `models.CrawlDiagnostics` filled in as the crawl
    ends. Passed in rather than returned so every existing caller keeps
    working unchanged - the same shape `PageDiagnostics` already uses. What
    it records is what the crawl did *not* reach: one that stopped at its
    page limit leaves a queue behind, and once the results are a list of
    `PageResult` those addresses are gone. "30 pages, no findings" then
    reads as a verdict on the site rather than on the thirty.

    Named `walk` and not `diagnostics` for a reason worth keeping: the loop
    below binds `diagnostics` to a fresh `PageDiagnostics` on every page, so
    a parameter of that name is shadowed by the first iteration. It was, and
    the end-of-crawl numbers went onto the last page's diagnostics instead -
    silently, because both objects take an attribute assignment happily.

    cancelled, when supplied, is a zero-argument callable checked between
    pages, network responses and browser renders. It cannot interrupt a
    socket inside `requests`, but it prevents the next expensive unit from
    starting and gives every UI surface one cooperative stop contract.
