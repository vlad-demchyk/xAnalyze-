#: block of `elif`s plus a matching block of `action_*` methods, which had
#: already drifted once (the README documented shortcuts 1-6 while the menu
#: had seven).
#:
#: Logs is 8 rather than 5, which would read better. The numbers 1-7 are
#: documented, are in muscle memory and are what the tests press: a new entry
#: that renumbers the existing ones makes every one of those wrong, and a
#: menu shortcut is a promise as much as a label.
