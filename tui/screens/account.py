"""Sign in to the account that pays for AI calls.

Settings has always let a person choose `xformat` as the provider, and the
TUI had no way to sign in to it - so choosing it and having no session was
reachable from here and only fixable from the window or from
`xanalyze ai login`. A setting whose one prerequisite lives on another
surface is a setting that lies about what it does.

The password is never stored, here or anywhere: `sign_in` exchanges it for a
token that goes to the OS keychain, and the field is cleared before the
result is even looked at. That is the same contract `ui/sign_in_dialog.py`
and `cli_impl.aicmds.cmd_ai_login` keep, and it is why this screen exists
while an API-key field still deliberately does not - a key is a secret that
would have to be *kept*, and a password here is one that is spent.

The call is made off the UI thread. A sign-in on a captive network is thirty
seconds of a frozen interface otherwise, which is the same reason
`UpdateScreen` threads its own network call.

        This used to disable both fields and the button whenever the chosen

        could not sign in from here at all. The reasoning was that a screen
        reporting the xFormat session while the run pays through Claude Code
        answers a question nobody asked; the effect was a circular
        dependency, because choosing xFormat in Settings before having an
        account is exactly backwards.

        So the state line still says which provider pays, and the form stays
        usable. Signing in while another provider is selected offers to
        switch - after the sign-in worked, when there is something to switch
