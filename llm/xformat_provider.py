"""xFormat provider — calls billed to the user's xFormat subscription
instead of a personal Anthropic key.

This was written against a guessed `/api/v1/*` contract before the backend
was settled. It is now written against the real one, read from the backend
source (`xformat-backend/api/src/`):

    POST {base}/api/auth/login      {"email", "password"}
      -> {"user": {"id", "email"},
          "accessToken", "accessTokenExpiresAt"}
         and a refresh token in the httpOnly cookie `xf_refresh_token`

    POST {base}/api/auth/refresh    {"refreshToken"}  (optional — see below)
      -> the same shape

    POST {base}/api/auth/logout
      -> revokes the session server-side, not just locally

    GET  {base}/api/me
      -> {"profile": {"email", "plan", ...},
          "usage": {"tokensAllocated", "tokensUsed", ...} | null,
          "stats": {...}}

    POST {base}/api/ai/{feature}    {"messages": [{"role", "content"}]}
      -> {"message": {"role", "content"}, "usage", "execution": {"model"}}

Three things about this backend shape are worth knowing, because each one
caused a bug in the first version:

**The refresh token lives in a cookie, and only in a cookie.** The web app
never sees it, and - verified live on 2026-08-19 - neither `login` nor
`refresh` puts it in the response body: the only carrier is `Set-Cookie`.
A desktop client has no browser cookie jar that survives a restart, so the
cookie is read out of each response and stored like any other secret, then
replayed two ways on refresh: in the session's cookie jar *and* in the
request body. The backend accepts either (the body fallback exists for the
native apps for exactly this reason), and sending both means one
implementation covers a cookie that was rotated and a cookie that was never
received.

**Refresh rotates, and the old token is spent immediately.** Replaying one
answers 401 `Invalid Refresh Token: Already Used`, so the stored copy must
be replaced after every call. It must be read from the response that issued
it rather than from the jar: the jar can hold two cookies of this name at
once - the primed one on the API host at path `/`, and the server's on
`.xformat.net` at path `/api/auth` - and asking such a jar for one value
raises. That is what kept a spent token stored in the first version.

**The access token has two clocks.** Supabase issues it for about an hour,
but this API only accepts it for the first 15 minutes
(`accessTokenExpiresAt` in the response says when it stops being accepted).
Trusting the JWT's own expiry would mean 45 minutes of 401s per session, so
the value from the response body is what is stored — as an absolute
millisecond timestamp, not a duration.

`XFormatEndpoints` still exists and is still overridable from Settings, so
a backend change can be corrected without shipping a new build; the
defaults are simply real now rather than hypothetical.
