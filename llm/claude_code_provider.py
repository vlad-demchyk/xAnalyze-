"""Claude Code provider — calls run through the `claude` CLI already
installed and signed in on this machine.

Why this exists as a third provider rather than a setting on the Anthropic
one: when this tool is driven from inside Claude Code (a hook, a CI step, an
agent running `cli.py`), there is already an authenticated Claude session in
the environment. Sending those calls to the xFormat subscription instead
would bill a second account for work the first one is already paying for,
and would fail outright on a machine that has Claude Code but no xFormat
login. So inside Claude Code the right backend is Claude Code itself.

Three things about driving the CLI are worth knowing, because each one cost
a call to discover:

**`--bare` cannot be used.** It restricts authentication to
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, which is precisely what this provider exists to avoid;
with it, a perfectly signed-in machine reports "Not logged in".

**The default run loads the whole agent.** Without
`--strict-mcp-config`/`--allowedTools ""` a one-sentence rewrite ships the
full tool catalogue and every configured MCP server as input: measured at
~33k tokens for a 17-token answer. With them the same call reads a small
cached prefix instead.

**The working directory is part of the prompt.** Claude Code discovers
`CLAUDE.md` from the directory it runs in, so running in the scanned project
would let that project's house rules rewrite the user's copy. Calls are made
from a neutral empty directory for that reason.

Checking authentication is free here — `claude auth status --json` reads the
local credentials and calls nothing — which is why `auth_status()` on this
provider, unlike the xFormat one, costs nothing to ask.
